# Hate_Speech_Detection
Minor_project
The annotation architecture is designed to create data for 3
different sub tasks.
1. SUB-TASK A: classification of Hate Speech (HOF) and non-offensive content.
2. SUB-TASK B: If the post is HOF, sub-task B is used to identify the type of
hate.
3. SUB-TASK C: it decides the target of the post.
